# This script demonstrates how to trap signals and handle them using functions

# Task: Add traps for the INT and QUIT signals. If the script receives an INT signal,
#       reset the count to the maximum and tell the user they are not allowed to interrupt
#       the count. If the script receives a QUIT signal, tell the user they found the secret
#       to getting out of the script and exit immediately.
